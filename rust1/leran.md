# Things Learned In this first chapter:

### Cargo commands

     cargo init -> Initialse a project iwth main.rs file

     cargo build -> Build executable by default debug mode

     cargo run -> build executable and also execute

     cargo check -> compile the program but no executable (faster)

     cargo build --release 
     
     Production optimises the code by various methods removing dead code and function inlinng and stuff faster but slow to build
